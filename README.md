# batch-recorder
Simple batch recorder based on youtube-dl and streamlink

Install
1. youtube-dl
2. streamlink
3. ffmpeg (if you need convert file)

Edit .bat file: 
1. name  (for twitch the token is the name in the address bar)
![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/wWpTjHx/token.jpg "token")​
2. token (if you used youtube recorder)
![alt tag](https://i.ibb.co/wzFMkKn/token-2.jpg "token")​

Run bat file

P.S. 
1. For recording, it is still better to use streamlink, especially for twitch, as there is ad skipping.
2. To prevent recordings from interfering with you, create a new desktop 2 in Windows 10 and run the scripts directly there
